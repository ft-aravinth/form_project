            <p>1.1) The PEI will deliver the Course as set out in Schedule A to the Student, towards conferment of the stated qualification upon successful Course completion.</p>
            <p>1.2) The PEI confirms that the Course has been permitted by the Committee for Private Education (CPE) and no amendments have been made to the Course as set out in Schedule A, unless otherwise permitted by CPE.</p>
            <p>1.3) The Course Fees payable are set out in Schedule B and the optional Miscellaneous Fees in Schedule C.</p>
            <p>1.4) The PEI considers payment made 15 days/month* after the scheduled due date(s) in Schedule B as late. The PEI will explain to the Student its policy for late payment of Course Fees, including any late payment fee charged in Schedule C (if applicable) and any impact on Course/module completion (if applicable).</p>
            
        <h4>2) REFUND POLICY</h4>
        <h4>2.1) Refund for Withdrawal Due to Non-Delivery of Course:</h4>
            <p>The PEI will notify the Student within three (3) working days upon knowledge of any of the following:</p>
            <p>(i) It does not commence the Course on the Course Commencement Date;</p>
            <p>(ii) It terminates the Course before the Course Commencement Date;</p>
            <p>(iii) It does not complete the Course by the Course Completion Date;</p>
            <p>(iv) It terminates the Course before the Course Completion Date;</p>
            <p>(v) It has not ensured that the Student meets the course entry or matriculation requirement as set by the organisation stated in Schedule A within any stipulated timeline set by CPE; or</p>
            <p>(vi) The Student’s Pass application is rejected by Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA).</p>

            <p>The Student should be informed in writing of alternative study arrangements (if any), and also be entitled to a refund of the entire Course Fees and Miscellaneous Fees already paid should the Student decide to withdraw, within seven (7) working days of the above notice.</p>

        <h4>2.2) Refund for Withdrawal Due to Other Reasons:</h4>
            <p>If the Student withdraws from the Course for any reason other than those stated in Clause 2.1, the PEI will, within seven (7) working days of receiving the Student’s written notice of withdrawal, refund to the Student an amount based on the table in Schedule D.</p>

        <h4>2.3) Refund During Cooling-Off Period:</h4>
            <p>The PEI will provide the Student with a cooling-off period of seven (7) working days after the date that the Contract has been signed by both parties.</p>
            <p>The Student will be refunded the highest percentage (stated in Schedule D) of the fees already paid if the Student submits a written notice of withdrawal to the PEI within the cooling-off period, regardless of whether the Student has started the course or not.</p>

        <h4>2.4) Non-refundable Fee:</h4>
            <p>The Course Application Fee is non-refundable under any circumstances. The Course Application Fee refers to the fee that the Student pays to the PEI for the sole purpose of processing the application form submitted so that the PEI can check if the Student meets the course admission requirements. The Course Application Fee does not have any fee component that is used to offset course fee payment. Course Fees are listed in Schedule B.</p>

        <h4>2.5) Bad Financial Standing:</h4>
            <p>Bad Financial Standing (BFS) is imposed if the students have any outstanding fee or charges. When it occurs, BFS is automatically applied to the student’s record. If the student is in BFS, they will not be able to enrol for classes/ examinations and will be refused eligibility for graduation and provision of results/certificate competency transcript.</p>
            <p>If the students discontinue their unit/module enrolment, unit/module re-enrolment and/or re-admission will be refused until the outstanding balance, including late charges, have been paid in full. The Director may terminate a student’s enrolment during the teaching period, on the grounds that the student has not paid the outstanding balance of fees and charges. A student whose enrolment has been terminated may be reinstated if the student pays in full the total outstanding fee and charges due.</p>
